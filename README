--------------------------------

Summery:
This program allows a user to model the assets and investments of an individual
who is either financially literate or financially illiterate thoughout their
career. Specifically, the program simulates decisions involving savings accounts,
mortgage/debt payments and rent over 40 years, then models an individuals based
on either financially intelligent or unintelligent decisions.

Prerequisites:
Requires operating system that can run C language.

Instructions:
To use the program, the user runs FinancialSimulation in
terminal followed by two command line arguments. The first and second command
line arguments specify the names of the files data will be outputted for
financially literate and illiterate simulations, respectively.

Submission % ./FinancialSimulation output_fl.txt output_nfl.txt

After running FinancialSimulation, the program will finish by writing data to
the respective files from the command line. Each file will contain a
newline of the individuals wealth for each year of the simulation.

If the user wants more detailed outputs of the simulation. The user can
enter a third and forth command line argument to specify the names for
detailed data files for financially literate and illiterate simulations, respectively.

./FinancialSimulation output_fl.txt output_nfl.txt output_fl_level_II.txt output_nfl_level_II.txt

The detailed data files will output information about the simulation in the following 
format for all simulation years.

Developer:
FinancialSimulation.c is the main script of the program and contains int main(),
it also includes the simulation functions and all supporting functions.
FinancialSimulation.h is the header file of FinancialSimulation.c, it defines
all functions used along with the memory structure used during simulations.
TestFinancialSimulation.c tests individual functions used my int main(), this
includes void debt(), void house(), and int *simulate().
